## Purpose

Enhance the clarity, readability, and structure of ${input:doc} while avoiding unnecessary visuals or verbose language.

## Objectives

- Use simple, direct, and professional language.
- Follow the structure and tone of any provided reference file.
- Ensure content is easy to follow for technical readers.
- Maintain accuracy while improving flow and organization.

## Reference File Handling

When a reference Markdown file is provided:

1. Analyze the section structure, heading levels, and tone.
2. Align the document to match the organization and style of the reference.
3. Use consistent headings, formatting, and spacing.
4. Preserve the original meaning while improving structure.

## Writing Guidelines

- Use clear, neutral, and concise language.
- Avoid filler or overly descriptive terms.
- Explain concepts, steps, and outcomes directly.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet points.
- Keep headings concise (2–5 words when possible).
- Exclude unnecessary sections or images.

## Formatting Rules

- Follow valid Markdown syntax.
- Maintain a consistent heading hierarchy.
- Add blank lines after headings and around lists or code blocks.
- Use bullet points for lists and fenced code blocks for examples.
- Format inline code as `example`.
- Use **bold** or _italic_ sparingly to emphasize key terms.

## Tone and Style

- Maintain a professional, calm, and clear tone.
- Avoid marketing or persuasive language.
- Do not use first-person pronouns (e.g., we, I, our).
- Write for technical readers who value clarity over flair.

## Restrictions

- Do not include images, emojis, or decorative formatting.
- Avoid excessive emphasis or callouts.
- Exclude explanations about Markdown syntax.
- Make incremental improvements unless a full rewrite is necessary.
